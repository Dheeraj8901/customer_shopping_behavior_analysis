# customer_shopping_behavior_analysis
# An end-toend project showcasing how customer behavior analysis is done by using Python, SQL ,and powerBI.
## 📊 **Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis**

 **Overview**

This project presents an end-to-end data analytics workflow to understand customer shopping behavior and uncover actionable business insights. The analysis covers data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), SQL-based validation, and dashboard creation using Power BI. The project concludes with a structured report and a presentation prepared using Gamma.

This project follows an industry-style analytics pipeline, demonstrating skills in Python, SQL, data visualization, and business intelligence.

 **Dataset**

The dataset used for this project is **customer_shopping_behavior.csv**, which contains transactional and behavioral information such as:

- Customer demographics
- Product categories
- Purchase amounts
- Modes of shopping
- Payment methods
- Date of purchase

The dataset was analyzed to identify spending patterns, category preferences, seasonal trends, and customer tendencies.

 **Tools & Technologies**

- **Python** – Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- **PostgreSQL** – SQL querying & data validation
- **SQLAlchemy + psycopg2** – Database connectivity
- **Power BI Desktop** – Dashboard creation
- **Gamma App** – Presentation creation
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Exploratory analysis and scripting
- **GitHub** – Project hosting

 **Project Workflow**

 **1. Data Loading (Python)**

- Loaded the dataset using Pandas
- Inspected structure, dimensions, datatypes, and null values

 **2. Data Cleaning**

- Removed duplicates
- Handled missing values
- Standardized column formats
- Corrected inconsistent entries
- Extracted meaningful features (date parts, categories, etc.)

 **3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

Performed a detailed exploration that covered:

- Customer demographics
- Spending distributions
- Popular product categories
- Seasonal purchase trends
- Mode-of-payment preferences
- Shopping frequency patterns
- Store vs. online comparison

Visualizations included bar charts, histograms, boxplots, correlation analysis, and trend plots.

 **4. SQL-Based Analysis (PostgreSQL)**

The cleaned dataset was imported into a PostgreSQL database.

SQL queries were executed to cross-validate insights and perform deeper analysis.

Queries included:

- Category-wise spending
- Top customers by total purchase
- Monthly sales trends using GROUP BY
- Purchase behavior by gender or age group
- High-value vs. low-value customer distribution

 **5. Power BI Dashboard**

A fully interactive Power BI dashboard was created to visualize:

- Key KPIs (Total Sales, Total Orders)
- Category-wise performance
- Customer demographic breakdown
- Month-over-month sales trends
- Location-based performance
- Mode-of-purchase & payment preferences

The dashboard supports dynamic filtering using slicers for customer type, category, payment method, and location.

 **6. Report Creation**

A structured report was prepared summarizing:

- Objectives
- Data quality checks
- EDA findings
- SQL insights
- Dashboard interpretation
- Business recommendations

 **7. Presentation (Gamma.AI)**

A clean, modern presentation was built using Gamma to showcase:

- Approach
- Key visuals
- Insights
